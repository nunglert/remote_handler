"""Example -- amorphous-matrix embedding anneal on a metal/solvent interface.

Demonstrates ``AmorphousEmbeddingSampler``: extract regions of interest (ROIs)
from an uncertainty-tagged MD trajectory, carve an oriented box around each
ROI, repair the cut boundary, and anneal the mobile shell around the frozen
ROI with a multi-stage LAMMPS deck driven by a GRACE foundation-model
potential.

The system here is a Cu slab with a water overlayer, so the carved box is
oriented to the copper surface normal (``topology_mode="interface"``) and the
anneal is split into two stages so the metal and the solvent each equilibrate
their own density independently. See ``ame2/run_remote.py`` for the same
pipeline on a homogeneous bulk solid, where several of these interface-only
pieces (surface-normal detection, an oriented/asymmetric box, molecule-repair
cleanup, the two-stage split) fall away.

This runs a single sampling step directly against the sampler, not a full
active-learning loop (see ``ActiveLearningHandler`` for that) -- useful for
testing/tuning the extract+anneal pipeline in isolation before wiring it into
a campaign.

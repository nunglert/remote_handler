"""Example -- amorphous-matrix embedding anneal on a bulk solid.

Demonstrates ``AmorphousEmbeddingSampler``: extract regions of interest (ROIs)
from an uncertainty-tagged MD trajectory, carve a box around each ROI, and
anneal the mobile shell around the frozen ROI with a LAMMPS deck driven by a
GRACE foundation-model potential.

The system here is a bulk, fully periodic Si/SiO2 mixture with no free
surface, which is the simplest case this sampler supports:
``topology_mode="bulk"`` skips surface-normal detection entirely (no OVITO
needed), the carved box is a plain axis-aligned cube, and a single anneal
stage covers every species since there is no substrate/solvent split to
stagger. See ``ame1/run_remote.py`` for the interface variant, where an
oriented box, a two-stage anneal and molecule-repair cleanup are all needed
because that system has a free surface and a distinct solvent phase.

This runs a single sampling step directly against the sampler, not a full
active-learning loop (see ``ActiveLearningHandler`` for that) -- useful for
testing/tuning the extract+anneal pipeline in isolation before wiring it into
a campaign.
